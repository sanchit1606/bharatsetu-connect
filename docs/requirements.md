## Project Overview

### Vision Statement

BharatSetu aims to democratize access to critical information and public services for Indian citizens through AI-powered tools, addressing gaps in health literacy, civic awareness, legal rights, and women's health education.

### Problem Statement

- **Health Literacy:** Only 33% of Indian consumers check nutrition facts on product labels [FSSAI, 2013]
- **Civic Issues:** 157 million Indians still practice open defecation despite infrastructure efforts [UNICEF, 2022]
- **Legal Awareness:** Majority of Indians are unaware of fundamental legal rights [India Justice Report, 2023]
- **Women's Health:** Only 48% of adolescent girls knew about menstruation before menarche [IJCM, 2016]
- **Medical Literacy:** 39% of patients cannot correctly interpret standard lab reports [JMS, 2021]

### Solution Approach

Five integrated AI-powered modules providing multilingual, accessible, privacy-first services to empower citizens with knowledge and tools for better decision-making.
